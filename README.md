# Spotify-Jukebox
Spotify API based Web Song request 

Link your Spotify Account to add songs directly to the queue. 
The best way to use this is with a playlist so that when there
are no songs in the queue Spotify resorts to the playlist.

Searching for songs will display the song names, artist and album
cover in a simple, tablet/phone friendly webpage such as can be 
used in a 'Jukebox' Scenario.

If you have any requests open an issue or contact me at kane@wattleit.com.au

Use the demo at request.kane.network freely :)
